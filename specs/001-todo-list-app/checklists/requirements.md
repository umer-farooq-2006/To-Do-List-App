- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Detailed Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: Specification focuses on user needs and business value without prescribing technical implementation. Written appropriately for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Requirement Completeness**: All 15 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria. Success criteria include specific measurable metrics (time bounds, percentages, counts). Edge cases cover error handling, boundary conditions, and exceptional scenarios.

**Feature Readiness**: Four prioritized user stories provide complete coverage of core functionality. Each story is independently testable and deliverable. Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format for clear testability.
